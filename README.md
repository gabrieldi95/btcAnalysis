# BitCoin Analysis
This script uses fractal analysis techniques to understand better the way that the BitCoin value changes through time.

### Time
It only uses data from one year (June, 2016 to June, 2017), but you can download the same data from [this site](https://www.coindesk.com/price/), from any time range you want. I took only one year because it values from before is too low.
